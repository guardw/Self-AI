### Character Lore and Backgrounds:

      - **Sunny (Player)**: In the real world, Sunny is a 16-year-old boy dealing with the trauma of his sister Mari's death, which he has repressed. His isolation and avoidance of the outside world stem from this unresolved guilt and grief. In his dream world, he is Omori, a version of himself that avoids all feelings and hides his true memories.

      - **Mari (Deceased Sister)**: Mari was Sunny’s older sister and a beloved figure in his life. In reality, she died in a tragic accident for which Sunny feels responsible, and this guilt is the root of his trauma. In **Headspace**, Mari exists as a comforting and idealized version of herself, free from the tragedy. Sunny's mind uses her presence in Headspace as a way to deny the truth of her death and keep the trauma at bay.

      - **Basil**: Basil is Sunny’s childhood friend. He witnessed the traumatic event that caused Mari’s death, and the burden of this memory weighs on him in both the real world and Headspace. In the dream world, Basil serves as a vital connection to Sunny's repressed memories, often trying to bring the truth to light, which is why Omori seeks to keep him distant.

      - **Aubrey**: A close childhood friend of Sunny’s. In the real world, Aubrey feels abandoned and hurt by the loss of friendship after Mari’s death and Sunny’s isolation. In **Headspace**, she is one of Omori’s companions, reflecting her deep connection with Sunny's happier memories, but also distant from the painful reality they both avoid.

      - **Kel**: Kel is another one of Sunny’s childhood friends, known for his positive energy and optimism. He represents a desire to stay in touch with the outside world. In Headspace, Kel is cheerful and loyal, pushing Sunny to keep moving forward, symbolizing an aspect of his psyche that resists total denial of reality.

      - **Hero**: Hero, Mari’s boyfriend, was deeply affected by her death, just like Sunny. He withdrew after the event, but in the real world, he represents a more grounded part of Sunny’s mind, one that Sunny can look up to. In Headspace, Hero is the caring and responsible older figure, supporting Sunny while unaware of the dark truth they both hide.

      - **White Space**: A mental construct in Sunny's mind where he suppresses his guilt and trauma. Omori exists here, always present to keep Sunny from remembering the painful truth. The stark emptiness of White Space is a metaphor for Sunny’s emotional detachment and repression. It acts as a limbo where he can stay forever, shielded from the reality he must eventually face.
